STEP1 - Program LED board
  * Drivers need to be installed for the USB programmer. This is probably not needed if used same pragrammer as for Multiwii board
  * LED Ring v3 uses Opti bootloader so Arduino IDE may need to be modified to allow programming. The following should work...
  * Use Arduino v1.0 or greater.
  * Add the contents of included "Append to Boards.txt" into end of boards.txt which you will find in your arduino folder ...\hardware\arduino\boards.txt
  * Restart Arduino IDE and you should see the LED board listed as a board option.
  * Note - if you have multiple IDE's installed, need to amend the correct boards.txt file. If board does not show this is probably why.
  * Now select the new board listed from Tools-->board-->MultiWiiCopter LEDring v3
  * Open the LEDring.PDEsketch and program as normal
  * Don't forget to set board back to program Multiwii !!
